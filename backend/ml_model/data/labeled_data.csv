Marines fly a diverse range of aircraft including the F-18 Hornet, AH-1 Cobra and MV-22 Osprey.  The Marine Corps flies the most capable aircraft, with the highest trained pilots in the most extreme situations.  Whether you fly a jet, a helicopter, or tilt rotor aircraft, you will be at the controls.

If you are interested in someday working for the FBI, CIA, federal government, commercial airlines, or as an executive in a Fortune 500 company, the OCS program may be right for you.

You will attend what Inc. magazine calls ""the best management training program in America"", and test your leadership potential, physical fitness and mental prowess.  

You will earn approximately $4,000 plus room and board during the 10 week summer training.

Marine Lieutenants receive starting salaries of $40,000-49,000 a year plus incredible benefits including a $4,000 signing bonus and fully funded graduate school.  If you're interested in flying jets or helicopters as a Marine aviator, this is also the only military Officer program that will guarantee you a spot in flight school.
 
You will not incur any obligation to the Marine Corps even after completing the training.  You can choose whether or not to continue with the program at any time.

No prior aviation experience is required, and you will be guaranteed a spot in flight school before committing to anything.
